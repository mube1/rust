Fun little adventures in math, proof systems, and beyond.
Just starting out ... 
:)

- primality test
- list all relatively primes less than n
- Frievalds matrix check via [python](https://github.com/mube1/cryptography_adventures/blob/main/Frievalds_Matrix_check.py)
- Medium Blog Started [part 1](https://medium.com/@ube10/zk-journey-part-1-my-journey-begins-326d746e0c0b)
- Reed Solomon fingerprinting 
- In progress on sumcheck protocol ( Hard coded works, did it for brainstorming, trying to make it generic)
- - Challenges so far
  - - to implement or not to implement my polynomial parser? [?](https://github.com/philippeitis/rustnomial)
  - - Ensuring Fn is a field for defining a finite field for the polynomials?
   
- Done with the [sumcheck protocol](https://github.com/mube1/sumcheck/blob/main/README.md)
