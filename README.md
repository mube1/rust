Fun little adventures in math, proof systems, and beyond.
Just starting out ... 
:)

- primality test
- list all relatively primes less than n
- Frievalds matrix check via [python](https://github.com/mube1/cryptography_adventures/blob/main/Frievalds_Matrix_check.py)
- Reed Solomon fingerprinting ( Hardcoding for brainstorming)
- In progress on sumcheck protocol
- - Challenges so far
  - - to implement or not to implement my polynomial parser? [?](https://github.com/philippeitis/rustnomial)
  - - Ensuring Fn is a field for defining a finite field for the polynomials?
