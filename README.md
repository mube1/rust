Little math adventures in Rust
:)

- primality test
- list all relatively primes less than n
- In progress on sumcheck protocol
- Reed Solomon fingerprinting ( for brain storming)
- Challenges so far
  - - to implement or not to implement my polynomial parser? [?](https://github.com/philippeitis/rustnomial)
  - - Ensuring Fn is a field for defining a finite field for the polynomials?
